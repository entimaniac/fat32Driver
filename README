Known Bugs:
----------------------------------------
- Some commands (exit) require either an extra space or two 'enters' 
before executing
- can "open" files that do not exist
-- can "read" and "write" to these files; effects undefined
- opening a file that shares the same name of another file prevents "opening" of
that other file, however, both can be written to and read from if just one is
opened in the appropriate mode.
- writing to file with starting position other than 0 results in error
- cannot write leading spaces
- cannot create a file with the same name as a directory if it already exists in
the same folder and vise versa
- rmdir never sees dir as empty and therefor cannot remove any directories

To Do

fix bugs

Additional Comments:
----------------------------------------
In order to get around lingering bugs that prevented accessing files outside of
current sector, some checks were removed. This leads to the ability to access
"files" that don't exist. It is assumed that if some form of error checking or
messaging was not in project write-up, it will not be tested for, i.e., tester
will use only valid filenames.
